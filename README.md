## 📖 Introduction

This project is an open-source dashboard designed specifically for VinFast EV owners. It leverages the vehicle's telemetry data to provide a "Digital Twin" experience, offering real-time insights into battery health, charging status, tire pressure, and environmental conditions.

Our goal is to create a UI that matches the premium quality of the car itself—clean, modern, and informative.

## ✨ Features

- **Digital Twin Visualizer**: Accurate representation of vehicle status including doors, locks, and tires.
- **Mobile-First Experience**: Optimized specifically for phone screens with zero scrollbars, fixed viewports, and touch-friendly layouts.
- **Real-time Telemetry**: Monitoring of Battery SOC, Range, Power consumption, and Charging time.
- **Safety Monitor**: Integrated alerts for Tire Pressure (TPMS), Door Ajar, and Intrusion.
- **System Health**: Overview of ECU versions (BMS, Gateway, MHU) and FOTA updates.
- **Responsive Design**: A "Bento Grid" layout that adapts seamlessly from Desktop to Mobile.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Core**: React (Vite/Astro), Tailwind CSS, Nanostores.
- **API**: Serverless Proxy (Astro SSR) for CORS & Rate Limiting.
- **Integration**: Official/Reverse-Engineered VinFast API.
